## Clustering and classification algorithms

This repo provides a simple skeleton for implementing the algorithms without using SKLearn. Caution, this is only meant for learning. This is NOT production grade code and requires a lot of optimisations. Use this repo contents only to follow the step-by-step process of how the algorithm works.
